      <description>I am behavioral and experimental economist with interests in microeconomic theory and economics of networks. I am particularly interested in how our individual rationality and its context (be it costly information, social norms, or network structures) affect our choices. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from Washington University in St. Louis. Currently, I work at the Smith Institute for Political Economy and Philosophy at Chapman University as a postdoctoral research associate.</description>
