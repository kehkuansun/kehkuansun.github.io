      <description>I am a behavioral and experimental economist. My research interest lies in understanding human nature through the lens of behavioral models of rational agents. I try to uncover the structure of underlying preferences that are hidden behind the constraints of information, social norms, or network structures, through both theoretical and experimental means. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from Washington University in St. Louis. I am an Assitant Professor in the Department of Economics at Fairfield University.</description>
