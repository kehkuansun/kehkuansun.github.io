      <description>I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics, Washington University in St. Louis. My primary fields of interest are behavioral and experimental economics, along with the secondary interests in microeconomic theory and economics of networks.
 I come from a multicultural background as a descendant of a Chinese immigrant family in South Korea. Born and raised in a rural town of Korea, my journey began when I first arrived in Kansas as an exchange student in my high school days.</description>
