      <description>I am a behavioral and experimental economist studying microeconomic theory and the economics of networks. I am particularly interested in how our individual rationality and its context (be it costly information, social norms, or network structures) affect our choices. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from Washington University in St. Louis. Currently, I am a postdoctoral research associate at the Smith Institute for Political Economy and Philosophy at Chapman University.</description>

      <description>Publication &amp;ldquo;Habits as Adaptations: An Experimental Study&amp;rdquo;
with Ludmila Matyskov√°, Brian Rogers, and Jakub Steiner, Games and Economic Behavior, Volume 122, July 2020, pp. 391-406 [paper] Working Paper &amp;ldquo;Lying Aversion and Vague Communication: An Experimental Study&amp;rdquo; (revise and resubmit, European Economic Review)
with Stella Papadokonstantaki [poster (AEA2022)] [video][draft]
Using a novel experimental design that allows participants to be vague while at the same time isolating the internal cost of lying from the social identity cost of appearing dishonest, we explore the extent to which these two types of lying costs affect communication.</description>
