    <p>Thank you for participating in the experimental study for the project &lsquo;Non-Allais Paradox and Context-Dependent Risk Attitudes&rsquo; from 3/23/2024 to 3/24/2024. Here below is a quick overview of the summary of our finding. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact the researchers.</p>
<h3 id="research-summary">Research Summary</h3>
<p>Thank you for participating in our research study on decision-making under risk. In this study, we explored how people make choices between risky options. Economists have used a well-known theory called <strong>Expected Utility Theory</strong> to explain how people make decisions involving risk. This theory assumes that people evaluate all possible outcomes and the probabilities of those outcomes to make the best decision. However, over time, researchers have found that people don’t always follow this theory when they face real-life decisions. This has led to the development of alternative theories.</p>
<p>Our research aimed to test a new idea that people&rsquo;s risk preferences might change depending on the situation, or <strong>context</strong>—specifically, the possibility of experiencing disappointment. For example, it is possible that people may be more willing to take risks when the likelihood of disappointment is high. On the other hand, when some amount of money or wealth is guaranteed, people may prefer to avoid taking risks. We call this concept <strong>context-dependent risk attitudes</strong>, suggesting that people’s preferences for risks depend not just on the individual options in front of them, but also on the context how the options are presented.</p>
<p>To test this idea, we asked participants to make a series of choices between two options (called Option A and Option B), each representing different types of lotteries with varying outcomes. By changing the size of the worst possible outcome, we could study how participants&rsquo; preferences changed depending on the context of disappointment.</p>
<h3 id="main-findings">Main Findings</h3>
<p>Our experiment involved 150 participants, who were asked to make decisions across two stages of tasks, where each task involved choosing between two lotteries with different prize combinations.</p>
<h4 id="stage-1">Stage 1:</h4>
<p>In the first stage, we varied the <strong>worst possible prize</strong> that could be received between the two lottery options while keeping everything else the same. We wanted to see if participants would switch from one lottery to another based on the size of the worst prize.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finding 1</strong>: Over half of the participants (52.0%) switched their choice between Option A and Option B when the size of the worst prize changed. This suggests that many participants adjusted their risk preferences based on how much they stood to lose in the worst-case scenario.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="stage-2">Stage 2:</h4>
<p>In the second stage, we kept the worst prize constant and instead varied the <strong>probability of receiving the worst outcome</strong>. Here, we were interested in whether participants would switch their choices based on changes in the likelihood of disappointment.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Finding 2</strong>: In this stage, 61.3% of participants switched their choices between the two options, showing that participants&rsquo; risk preferences were also influenced by changes in the probability of receiving the worst outcome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Finding 3</strong>: Importantly, we found that 82.1% of participants who switched their choices in Stage 1 also switched in Stage 2. This suggests that participants’ risk attitudes were not random but were consistent with the idea that context (in terms of both prize size and probability) plays a key role in decision-making.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the results support our idea that people exhibit <strong>context-dependent risk attitudes</strong>. That is, participants changed their willingness to take risks depending on the likelihood of disappointment, confirming our initial hypothesis. These findings help us understand how people might behave differently in real-world situations involving risk, such as in financial decisions, insurance choices, or gambling.</p>
